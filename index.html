        <h1><strong>Hypostomus Luteus</strong></h1>
            <p>Hypostomus Luteus is a very rare and special plecostomus from South America.</p>
             <p>They are found in Northern Argentina on the border of Brazil living in the Rio Uruguay. </p>
             <p>They live in the fast flowing water feeding on the algae.</p>
            <p>Since not much was know about these fish, the team from Imperial Tropicals went down to Argentina to learn more about them and the habit that they live in.</p> 
            <p>In the future we plan on putting the videos on our YouTube page of that expedition.</p>
